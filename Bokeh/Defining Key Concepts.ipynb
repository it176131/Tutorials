    "In order to make the best use of this User Guide, it is important to have context for some high level concepts and terms. Here is a small glossary of some of the most important concepts in Bokeh.\n",
    "___\n",
    "**Application**\n",
    "> A Bokeh application is a rendered Bokeh document, running in a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BokehJS**\n",
    "> The JavaScript client library that actually renders the visuals and handles the UI interactions for Bokeh plots and widgets in the browser. Typically, users will not have to think about this aspect of Bokeh much *(\"We write the JavaScript, so you don't have to!\")* but it is good to have basic knowledge of this dichotomy. For full details, see the [BokehJS](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide/bokehjs.html#devguide-bokehjs) chapter of the [Developer Guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide.html#devguide)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documents**\n",
    "> An organizing data structure for Bokeh applications. Documents contain all the Bokeh Models and data needed to render an interactive visualization or application in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding**\n",
    "> Various methods of including Bokeh plots and widgets into web apps and pages, or the IPython notebook. See [Embedding Plots and Apps](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html#userguide-embed) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Glyphs**\n",
    "> The basic visual building blocks of Bokeh plots, e.g. lines, rectangles, squares, wedges, patches, etc. The `bokeh.plotting` interface provides a convenient way to create plots centered around glyphs. See [Plotting with Basic Glyphs](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html#userguide-plotting) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models**\n",
    "> The lowest-level objects that comprise Bokeh \"scenegraphs\". These live in the `bokeh.models` interface. *Most users will not use this level of interface to assemble plots directly*. However, ultimately all Bokeh plots consist of collections of models, so it is important to understand them enough to configure their attributes and properties. See [Styling Visual Attributes](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#userguide-styling) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server**\n",
    "> The Bokeh server is an optional component that can be used for sharing and publishing Bokeh plots and apps, for handling streaming of large data sets, or for enabling sophisticated user interactions based off of widgets and selections. See [Running a Bokeh Server](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html#userguide-server) for more explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Widgets**\n",
    "> User interface elements outside of a Bokeh plot such as sliders, drop down menus, buttons, etc. Events and updates from widgets can inform additional computations, or cause Bokeh plots to update. Widgets can be used in both standalone applications or with the Bokeh server. For examples and information, see [Adding Interactions](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html#userguide-interaction)\n",

    "Bokeh is intended to provide a quick and simple interface to data scientists and domain experts who do not want to be distracted by the details of the software, and also provide a richly detailed interface to application developers and software engineers who may want more control or access to more sophisticated features. Because of this, Bokeh takes a layered approach and offers different programming interfaces appropriate to different levels of use. This section provides an overview of the various interfaces that are available to Bokeh users, as well as more context about the most important concepts central to the library.

    "Bokeh is actually composed of two library components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first component is a JavaScript library, BokehJS, that runs in the browser. This library is responsible for all of the rendering and user interaction. Its input is a collection of declarative JSON objects that comprise a \"scenegraph\". The objects in this scenegraph describe everything that BokehJS should handle: what plots and widgets are present and in what arrangement, what tools and renderers and axes the plots will have, etc. These JSON objects are converted into [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) Models in the browser, and are rendered by corresponding [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is a library in Python (or [other languages](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/quickstart.html#quickstart-other-languages) that can generate the JSON described above. In the Python Bokeh library, this is accomplished at the lowest level by exposing a set of \"model\" classes that exactly mirror the set of [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) Models that are created in the browser. These python model classes know how to validate their content and attributes, and also how to serialize themselves to JSON. ALl of these low level models live in the **low-level** [bokeh.models](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models.html#bokeh-models) interface. Most of the models are very simple, usually consisting of a few property attributes and no methods. Model attributes can either be configured when the model is created, or later by setting attribute values on the model object. Here are some examples for a [`Rect`](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models/glyphs/rect.html#bokeh.models.glyphs.Rect) glyph object:"

For this reason, most users will probably want to use one of the higher level interfaces described below, unless they have specialized requirements that necessitate finer control.
