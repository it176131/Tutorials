    "Welcome to our Kaggle Machine Learning Tutorial. In this tutorial, you will explore how to tackle Kaggle Titanic competition using Python and Machine Learning. In case you're new to Python, it's recommended that you first take our free [Introduction to Python for Data Science Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science). Furthermore, while not required, familiarity with machine learning techniques is a plus so you can get the maximum out of this tutorial.\n",

When you hit the 'Submit Answer' button, every line of code is interpreted and executed by Python and you get a message whether or not your code was correct. The output of your Python code is shown in the console in the lower right corner. Python makes use of th `#` sign to add comments; these lines are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result.\n",
